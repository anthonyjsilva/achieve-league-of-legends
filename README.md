### About
Built using the Riot Games Developer API and runs in a Node environment. It uses Express server to serve files, node-fetch for HTTP requests, and Mustache template engine for rendering pages to the client.

### Roadblocks
- api key expires (site is no longer live)
- api key rate limiting
- multiple parallel http requests
- large data sets
